# Advent of Code 2022 (Day 7)
### Playground
The [daily quiz](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/7) was about calculating some directory and file sizes recursively.

I decided to go full OOP on this and after i was done it seemed a waste to not create a terminal-emulation of the elves file system.
I was already so close due to the way i approached it.

So you can run the script with `ruby playground.rb` and use the commands 
* `ls` 
* `cd ..`
* `cd /`
* `cd [directory]`
* `quit`

🎁 Enjoy this sneak peak into the Elven Device filesystem. 🎁
